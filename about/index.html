Both passionate about innovation and driven by a shared vision, Julius and Alon bring complementary skills and insights to their leadership roles at Klyos.</p>
        <p>Growing up with an insatiable curiosity for new trends, Julius was always drawn to the cutting-edge developments in technology and blockchain. His keen eye for identifying hidden opportunities led him to found Klyos at the age of 24, with a focus on pioneering investments in artificial intelligence. Julius's background in capital markets equips him with a strategic mindset, allowing him to approach investment opportunities with a unique and insightful perspective.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Alon developed a deep appreciation for evidence-based decision-making through his observations of prospect theory and distorted valuations in his family's investments. At 23, he co-founded Klyos alongside Julius, driven by a commitment to challenge assumptions and build conviction on hard evidence. Alon's vast network of savvy tech investors and his analytical acumen provide a solid foundation for the firm's investment strategies.</p>
        <p>Together, Julius and Alon create a symbiotic leadership dynamic that combines Julius's innovative foresight with Alon's evidence-driven approach.
